# SecureMerge – Cyber Risk Management for Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A)

## 📌 Project Overview
**SecureMerge** is a cybersecurity and Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) framework
designed to manage cyber risks throughout the **Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A)** lifecycle.

The project focuses on challenges faced by parent organizations that frequently acquire
smaller companies such as SaaS startups or regional service providers, where hidden cyber
risks often exist (legacy systems, unknown breaches, weak controls, and compliance gaps).

The framework covers:
- Pre-deal cyber due diligence
- Post-deal integration and isolation decisions
- Long-term governance and inherited risk tracking

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Define a **repeatable cyber due diligence process** for acquisition targets
- Align acquired entities with the parent company’s **security policies and risk appetite**
- Govern integration decisions:
  - Connect
  - Isolate
  - Ring-fence
  - Rebuild (clean-room)
- Track inherited cyber risks and remediation progress over time

## 🔍 Scope

### ✅ In Scope
- Cyber due diligence questionnaire and evidence checklist
- Risk scoring and classification model (Low / Medium / High)
- Integration playbooks:
  - Connect
  - Isolate
  - Ring-fence
  - Divest / Clean-room rebuild
- Integration governance, temporary exceptions, and remediation tracking

### ❌ Out of Scope
- Detailed technical migration plans or tool-level configurations
- Financial valuation or deal pricing analysis

---

## 🛠 Key Components

### 1️⃣ M&A Cyber Risk Framework
- Identification of common M&A cyber risks:
  - Unknown breaches
  - Unsupported operating systems
  - Weak identity and access controls
  - Missing or insufficient logging
  - Non-compliant SaaS usage
- Definition of an **acquisition-specific risk appetite**
  (what risks are acceptable and for how long)

---

### 2️⃣ Due Diligence Toolkit
- Standardized cyber due diligence questionnaire
- Evidence requirements:
  - Security policies
  - Network and system diagrams
  - Vulnerability scans
  - Penetration test reports
  - Audit and compliance findings
- Risk scoring model to classify targets as:
  - Low Risk
  - Medium Risk
  - High Risk

---

### 3️⃣ Integration & Isolation Strategy
Clear decision criteria for:
- Identity and directory integration
- Network connectivity
- Application and data access

Supported integration patterns:
- Full integration
- Segmented integration
- Ring-fenced environments
- Clean-room rebuild approach

---

### 4️⃣ Governance & Reporting
- M&A Cyber Risk Committee definition
- RACI matrix for accountability
- Remediation timelines and ownership
- Executive-level reporting and risk dashboards

---

## 📊 Deliverables
